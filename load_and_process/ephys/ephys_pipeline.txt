1. AP_preprocess_phase3 (get/save settings, do CAR, run kilosort)
--> changed to AP_preprocess_phase3_newOE (only uses new OE format) to allow for multiple experiments
2. AP_prepare_phy (if not already local, above does by default)
(2.5. AP_triage_kilosort - automatically triage units)
3. AP_save_phy: copy saved clusters to basket

(available: AP_pre_phy - quickly flip through waveform templates to throw out obviously bad ones)
