NOTE: this is being changed with different standards:
- make all functions operate on vectors of spike times/identity
- sync channel pulses saved separately as .mat file

1. kwik2dat (in github repository): convert OE data to raw data
2. AP_run_kilosort: wrapper for kilosort, copies/computes locally and save to basket
3. AP_prepare_phy: loads data to local drive
4. (AP_pre_phy: not written but considered for finding noise template to classify before phy)
5. Manually check/fix clustering in Phy
6. Copy saved clusters to basket (AP_save_phy?)

----------------
This has changed after moving to phase 3, making a new more permanent processing pipeline:

AP_preprocess_phase3 (get/save settings, do CAR, run kilosort)
[AP_prepare_phy (if not already local, above does by default) - haven't used yet so might not work]

AP_pre_phy - quickly flip through waveform templates to throw out obviously bad ones
