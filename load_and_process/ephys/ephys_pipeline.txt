1. AP_preprocess_phase3 (get/save settings, do CAR, run kilosort)

ALT (new OE only, and when multiple on/off recordings): 
--> AP_preprocess_phase3_newOE: each recording separately
--> AP_preprocess_phase3_newOE_concat_experiments: recordings concatenated

2. AP_prepare_phy (if not already local, above does by default)

ALT (when multiple on/off recordings): 
--> AP_prepare_phy_concat_experiments: recordings concatenated

(2.5. AP_triage_kilosort - automatically triage units)

3. AP_save_phy: copy saved clusters to basket

(available: AP_pre_phy - quickly flip through waveform templates to throw out obviously bad ones)
